# UI Optimization Plan - Grade Analysis & Growth Page

## Goal
Optimize the UI for Grade Analysis and Growth pages based on user feedback, focusing on visual consistency and beautification.

## Tasks

### 1. Grade Analysis - Average Score Rate Card
- [x] Locate the component for Grade Analysis (likely in `frontend/src/views/growth` or `frontend/src/views/homework`).
- [x] Remove the gradient background from the "Average Score Rate" card.
- [x] Update the style to match the adjacent buttons (unify style).

### 2. Grade Analysis - History Grade Record - Grade Detail Page
- [x] Locate the Grade Detail page/component.
- [x] Beautify the page layout and design (typography, spacing, visual hierarchy).

### 3. Little Growth Page - Honor Wall Button
- [x] Locate the "Little Growth" page (likely `frontend/src/views/growth/index.vue`).
- [x] Update the "Honor Wall" button style to match the "Growth Record" button.

## Verification
- [x] Run `pnpm run lint` and `pnpm run typecheck` to ensure no errors.
- [x] Verify visual changes (via code review since I cannot see the screen).
